version 0.6.0.0:

* switch to mpdecimal for the underlying C library.  This allows
higher limits on exponents and precision.  All arithmetic is now
(practically speaking) arbitrary precision.  This also allows more
operations, such as logarithms and all exponents.  As a possible
disadvantage, this might be slower than decNumber (but I have not
benchmarked this.)

version 0.4.0.4:

* test with GHC 7.8.2

* bundle in decNumber for easier building.

version 0.4.0.2:

* remove version upper bounds

* lower version lower bounds to allow building with GHC 7.4

* add Sunlight tests

version 0.4.0.0:

* removed bindings-dsl; see comments in git log

* made Quad an instance of Eq and Ord

version 0.2.0.2:

* updated .travis.yml for decnumber dependency

* Removed spurious dependencies from .cabal file
